# Module 1 Challenge

## User Story
AS A marketing agency

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Code Refactor

This challenge was to refactor starter code that was given and to modify it to provide accessibility. Using the "Scout Rule" I was tasked with cleaning the code up to make it easier to read and to take out unnessesary code as well as add to the code. This includes addimg and subtraction from the code in CSS and the HTML.
